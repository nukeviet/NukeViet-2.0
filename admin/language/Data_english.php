define("_DBHELP","<b>OPTIMIZE</b><br>should be used if you have deleted a large part of a table or if you have made many changes to a table with variable-length rows (tables that have VARCHAR, BLOB, or TEXT columns). Deleted records are maintained in a linked list and subsequent INSERT operations reuse old record positions. You can use OPTIMIZE to reclaim the unused space and to defragment the datafile.<br>
In most setups you don\'t have to run OPTIMIZE at all. Even if you do a lot of updates to variable length rows it\'s not likely that you need to do this more than once a month/week and only on certain tables.<br>
OPTIMIZE works the following way:<ul>
<li>If the table has deleted or split rows, repair the table.
<li>If the index pages are not sorted, sort them.
<li>If the statistics are not up to date (and the repair couldn\'t be done by sorting the index), update them.
</ul>Note that the table is locked during the time OPTIMIZE is running!</p>");
